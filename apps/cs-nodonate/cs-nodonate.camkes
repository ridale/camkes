Scenarios to consider:
- priority:
    - client priority == server priority - succeed
    - client priority < server priority  - succeed
    - client priority > server priority  - succeed
- scheduling context
    - client has enough SC: succeed
    - client doesn't have enough SC: succeed (roll over to the next period)
    - server has enough SC: succeed
    - server doesn't have enough SC: succeed (roll over to the next period)
- if client/server doesn't have enough SC
    - budget << period: succeed - longer delay
    - budget < period: succeed - shorter delay
    - budget = period: succeed - no delay

should we time how long the calls take? or does it matter (thinking behind this: tell the difference between a call succeeding in one period or having to wait for it to reset and continuing when it goes over budget and also how long the period is)
